<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://barhoppr.herokuapp.com/)

I chose to clone Untappd because of its interesting premise, which involves users rating beers they've had at different venues, and share their thoughts with other users. The difference between Untappd and Barhoppr though is that Barhoppr doesn't limit drinks to beers, but any alcoholic drink. This project was a cool mix of a review/rating type website and a social media site, and offered some interesting challenges with context and shared state in the React/Redux frontend.

### Built With

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/v5/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Users can signup and login to use Barhoppr, and can login as a demo user to experience the website quickly.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][signup]](https://barhoppr.herokuapp.com)
[![Product Name Screen Shot][login]](https://barhoppr.herokuapp.com/signup)
<br>
<br>
Once logged in, the user is directed to the Bar Talk page, where logged-in users can view a global feed of checkins from other users, and post their own checkins.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][bartalk]](https://barhoppr.herokuapp.com/signup)

Included on the Bar Talk page are the following:

1. The Checkin Button - allows users to checkin and rate a drink in the database
2. The Sort By selector - users can sort the Bar Talk page by newest to oldest, oldest to newest, by rating highest to lowest, and by rating lowest to highest.
3. The Filter By selector - users can filter the Bar Talk page by drink, and see only the checkins for a particular drink. The user can then sort the specific drink checkin by any of the Sort By selections
4. Top 5 Rated Drinks - As checkins get added, the average rating of each drink is calculated, and the top 5 rated drinks are dynamically set to this list

<br>
<br>
On the Drinks page, users can view a list of drinks, and check them in by clicking their individual checkin buttons. Users can create a new drink to review by clicking the New Drink card:

[![Product Name Screen Shot][drinks]](https://barhoppr.herokuapp.com/bar-talk)
<br>
<br>
If a user can't find a drink they want to checkin, they can create a new one:

When creating a checkin on the Drinks page, you can see the rating average and number of ratings on that drink set dynamically.
